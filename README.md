# BankSimul ATM

School project by Ville Niemi, Johannes Päivärinta, Jere Siermala, Janne Pauna, Niko Kokko

The ATM Simulator is a software application that enables users to withdraw money. The application is designed to simulate the functions of an ATM machine. The software has been developed using JavaScript to create a REST API, and Qt Creator to create the frontend. The data is stored in a MySQL database that has four tables: omistaja, kortti, tili, and tilitapahtumat.

# Features

    Secure user login/logout
    Withdraw money
    Check account balance
    View transaction history
    Serial port communication
